# material-2014-colors

Google's original 2014 Material color/colour palette as a Python library.

Because I wanted to use the palette in some of my projects, but didn't want to
copy-paste values.

## Installation

Not yet available on PyPI, so install from GitHub, e.g.:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/elliot-100/material-2014-colors.git
```

## Usage

```python
from material_2014_colors import COLORS

RED_700 = COLORS["red"]["700"]  # equivalent to "#d32f2f"
```
